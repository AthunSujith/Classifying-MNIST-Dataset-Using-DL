# MNIST Digit Classification using Neural Networks

This repository contains a neural network implementation for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using Python and TensorFlow/Keras. The model is trained and evaluated with visualization of performance metrics over 30 epochs.

---

## üìä Project Overview

The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0‚Äì9) ‚Äî 60,000 for training and 10,000 for testing.

This project demonstrates:
- Loading and preprocessing the dataset
- Building a feedforward neural network
- Training and validating the model
- Plotting training and validation accuracy/loss
- Saving performance graphs
